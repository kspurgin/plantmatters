Acmella oleraca,,,,,,,,,
Allium tricoccum,Partial; Shade,Medium-Wet; Medium; Medium-Dry,0.5,0.75,White,June; July,Deer Resistant; Star,E,"Wild Leeks, also known as “Ramps”, are popular among urban foodies and foragers alike.   Although plentiful in some areas, Wild Leeks face the same pressures as other woodland plants, such as encroachment by invasive species, development and over-collection. If foraging for Wild Leeks, or other woodland natives, remember to harvest sustainably as they are very, very slow to reproduce. From successful seed germination to ramp harvest can be 5-7 years. There is plenty of flavor in the leaves alone. Clipping a few leaves instead of digging the bulb will ensure that a patch of Wild Leeks can thrive while being enjoyed. Wild Leek prefers typical woodland conditions: medium wet to medium dry soil and full to partial shade. It has reddish stalks reaching heights of 8"" in the spring. The early foliage dies back late spring before the white to creamy-white flowers appear in June or July.   The seeds of Allium tricoccum will bounce when dropped onto a hard surface; a seed dispersal mechanism of the plant."
Amorpha fruticosa,Full; Partial,Medium-Wet; Medium; Medium-Dry; Dry,12,12,Purple,June; July; August,Deer Resistant; Pollinators,C(10),"With most of its foliage in the upper third of the tall, bushy plant, Amorpha fruticosa can form thickets in dense plantings. The genus name is from the Greek for formless or deformed, because the single-petaled flower is unlike most blossoms in the pea family.   Other Common Names in use: Desert False Indigo and Indigo Bush. A vigorous plant throughout its range, this species can be invasive when planted outside of its historic regions.   We are waiting for an updated BONAP map for this species. It is native throughout much of the US but not native in Washington, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. It is a prohibited species is Maine and Connecticut. It is an invasive species in Connecticut and Washington. It is also not native in Michigan and the Northwest area of the U. S."
Amsonia taberneamontana,,,,,,,,,
Anaphalis margaritacea,Full; Partial,Medium-Dry; Dry,2,2,White,June; July; August; September,Deer Resistant; Star,C(30),"The stems and elongated leaves of  Pearly Everlasting are covered with white hairs.   Clustered at the top of erect stems, the tiny yellow flowers are enclosed by white papery bracts, often mistaken for petals.   The overall appearance is a pearly mound; a nice shape and color for a garden edge.   Pair it with a contrasting, bright plant like Bush's Poppy Mallow for a stunning display. There are separate male and female flowers, usually on separate plants, and they take on different gender-specific yellow or rust-yellow color as shown in the photo.   Blossoms can be dried for durable bouquets or flower arrangements as they keep their color and shape well. In the spring, this plant is a larvae host for the American Painted Lady- Vanessa virginensis (see photo of a surprise we found in our greenhouse one spring); you are sure to see this well-loved butterfly flying around your plants.   The young larvae create a silken web around the plant to feed.  This can look discouraging if you are trying to grow this plant, but like in many native plant-insect relationships, the plant generally makes a full recovery and flowers later in the summer.   Flowers persist and are profuse late-summer through fall to attract numerous beneficial insects. Pearly Everlasting is drought tolerant as it prefers full sun and dry, even rocky or poor soil conditions.   Moderate shade and medium soils are also tolerated. Its native range is vast from northern Maine to Virginia in the East, and Washington to Arizona in the West.  Spring Potted Plants (3-packs) ship when all plants are well-rooted and transit-ready, early May through June."

Andropogon virginicus,Full; Partial,Medium; Medium-Dry; Dry,4,4,,August; September,,C(30),"NEW! This perennial grass stands strongly upright and is good fuel for a prescribed burn. It has nice fall/winter color. It may also be called Broomstraw, Broomsedge Bluestem or Whiskey Grass. While not a preferred food by large herbivores such as cattle, small upland birds will eat seeds from the stalks in the winter when little else is available. Broomsedge's most valuable characteristic is its upright behavior where it can act as cover for groundnesting birds."
Anemone virginiana,Full; Partial; Shade,Medium-Dry; Dry,3,3,White,June; July; August,Deer Resistant; Recommeded for Landscaping,C(60),"Tall thimbleweed has long-lasting, off-white flowers, and as with the other anemones, what appear to be petals are actually colored sepals. The thimble-like seed heads are ornamental, becoming fluffy when they disperse their seed. This makes them fun multi-season plants of interest. Tall thimbleweed prefers open woods and clearings. Tall Thimbleweed is similar to its cousin Anemone cylindrica, but the fruiting cluster or ""thimble"" of virginiana is shorter than that of cylindrica. Both have lobed leaves, but the leaves of the cylindrica are wedge shaped while those of virginiana are rounded with fine teeth. Also called Tall or Virginia Anemone."
Anemonella thalictroides,Partial; Shade,Medium; Medium-Dry,0.5,0.5,Pink,April; May; June,Recommeded for Landscaping,E,"Rue Anemone is a delicate-looking early spring plant that blooms in various shades of pink. It begins to come up through brown leaves from the previous fall. The ""petals"" are actually sepals so they continue to bloom for a longer period of time. The root system produces very small tubers. It is similar in appearance to False Rue Anemone (Isopyrum biternatum) which has white blooms . Both are found in the same habitats. Rue Anemone, dies back in mid-summer making it a true spring ephemeral. Another scientific name is Thalictrum thalictroides."
Angelica atropurpureum,,,,,,,,,
Antennaria plantaginifolia,Full; Partial,Medium; Medium-Dry; Dry,1,1,White,April; May; June,Deer Resistant; Recommeded for Landscaping,C(60); D,"A member of the Aster family, Pussytoes are found across much of the eastern half of the continental United States: from Minnesota south to Texas, east to Florida and north to Maine. Other common names in use include Woman's Tobacco and Plantain-leaved Pussytoes. Pussytoes are usually grown for their velvety leaves rather than the white to pale pink flower. The late spring flowers look like tiny cat's feet, thus the name. These flowers will reach up to about a foot in height, but the leaves grow at ground level. Spreading by rhizomes, Pussytoes provide a good ground cover for dry areas such as rock gardens. Parts of the plant are poisonous so deer and rabbits and other small animals won't touch them. A. plantaginifolia and A. neglecta can be difficult to differentiate between with their primary differences existing in their leaves. A. plantaginifolia has broader leaves with 3-5 prominent veins compared to the 1-2 prominent veins seen in the narrower leaves of A. neglecta. A. neglecta also tends to be shorter. Both are host larvae hosts for the American Painted Lady (Vanessa virginensis)."

Aralia racemosa,Full; Partial,Wet; Medium-Wet; Medium,4,4,Green,July; August,Star,C(60),"Aralia racemosa matures to 4' in height and has green flowers and attractive reddish purple berries thereafter (not edible).   Spikenard is a large plant for a shaded area, so broad that it could be confused for a woodland shrub, but it is a true herbaceous perennial in that it dies back each fall and emerges from the ground up each spring.   It prefers wet to medium soil and blooms approximately from July to August when many woodland plants have finished flowering.   Spikenard can be difficult to move once the plant is established, so put it in its permanent site if you can.   Since it is a taller, wider plant, be cautious if planting next to smaller plants; it may soon overwhelm them.   Also called American Spikenard, it is a close relative of Wild Sarsaparilla."
Arisaema triphyllum,Partial; Shade,Medium-Wet; Medium; Medium-Dry,2,2,Green,April; May; June; July,Deer Resistant; Recommeded for Landscaping,F; L,"Jack-in-the-Pulpit is an excellent woodland garden plant. It is easy to cultivate and requires very little care once established. It thrives under a variety of conditions, but grows best in rich soil, shady, seasonally wet locations. The ""Jack"" is the spongy cylindrical structure, inside a leaf-like structure that is rolled into a deep cup with an overhanging roof, the ""pulpit"". The plant is said to have a burning, peppery taste so herbivores will not eat it but the berries are a food source for birds. These berries form mid-summer and are smooth, shiny green, 1 cm wide clustered on the thickened spadix, turning a bright red color before the plants go dormant early fall."
Asarum canadense,Shade,Medium-Wet; Medium; Medium-Dry,0.5,0.5,Red,April; May; June,Deer Resistant; Star,E,"Best known for its use as an attractive, low-growing ground cover in a shaded woodland setting, Wild Ginger is also deer-resistant.   It enjoys shaded, moist, somewhat acidic soils and will grow 6"" in height and the large heart-shaped leaves can be 6"" in diameter. The leaves are shiny when fully opened and the stems are hairy.   Unlike many early spring woodland plants,  Wild Ginger will keep its foliage throughout the season; it will not go dormant so it is a good species to plant among the spring ephemerals that do go dormant.   An attractive dark red flower will appear under the plant early spring but will fade fairly quickly. Although unpalatable to deer and other mammals, Many insects are attracted to Wild Ginger, including ants, believed to pollinate the plant.   It's best to propagate this plant by divisions rather than try to get it going from seed. Divide plants in the early spring before they are actively growing or in the fall as they go dormant. Many Native American Indian tribes used the root of the Wild Ginger plant as a seasoning or to treat colds and fevers.   European Settlers to this continent also learned to use the root as a flavor substitute to the tropical ginger they were used to.   Other common names include Woodland Ginger, Ginger Root, Heart Snakeroot, Indian Ginger, Asarabaca, and Catfoot."

Carex radiata,Partial; Shade,Medium-Wet; Medium,1,1,,June,Deer Resistant; Recommeded for Landscaping,C(60),"Pre-order now – This potted tray ships the week of April 26th, 2021. This Sedge forms thick clumps that will stand 12"" tall but then flop over as the seed begins to ripen. The fine texture, clump-forming habit, dark color of the foilage, star-like perigynium, and preference for full to partial shade make Carex radiata a nice addition to any shaded home landscape. Although it can grow in medium-moisture soils, it shoud be an area that never totally dries out. Starting by seed can be tricky and slow; consider plant divisions. As a cool-season species, it actively grows during the spring and fall when soil temperatures are cool. We used to call this Straight-Styled Wood Sedge, as referenced in Flora of Chicago for the straight-styled tip of the female flowers, as opposed to the very similar-looking curled tip of Carex rosea (Curly-styed Wood Sedge), which tolerates drier soils."
Castilleja coccinea,Full; Partial,Medium-Wet; Medium; Medium-Dry,2,2,Red,May; June,Recommeded for Landscaping,C(60); D; K,"Indian Paintbrush is a sought-after prairie beauty that prefers bright sites with medium-dry to medium-wet soils. An annual or biennial, its vivid scarlet bracts nearly hide small, greenish flowers and appear to have been dipped in paint. May and June are the typical bloom time, but because of its annual or biennial nature, you can see flowers blooming as late as October. Indian Paintbrush is one of the larval host plants of the Chalcedon Checkerspot, Edith's Checkerspot and of the Theona Checkerspot. A hemiparasitic plant is one that its roots seek out those of host plants, usually grasses, and tap into them for nutrition (see Germination Code K). If you will be starting Indian Paintbrush in a container, good hosts for many hemiparasitic species include low-growing grasses and sedges like Hairy Grama, Blue Grama, Buffalo Grass, Pennsylvania Sedge, Sweet Grass, and June Grass. With a knife make a 2"" deep cut at the base of the host plant. Sow seed in the cut, making sure seed is not more than 1/8"" deep. If host is transplanted at sowing time, the cut is not needed because damaged roots will be available for attachment by the parasite. You may also try sowing hemiparasitic and host species seeds together at the same time. To add hemiparasitic species to existing sites, scatter seed on soil surface (rake in if seed is large) in late fall."
Ceanothus americanus,Full; Partial,Medium; Medium-Dry; Dry,3,3,White,June; July; August,Pollinators; Recommeded for Landscaping,B; C(60),"A deciduous shrub that grows just 3' tall and is compact and rounded by nature. The dried leaves of New Jersey Tea make a flavorful tea that was popular during the Revolutionary War. Deep tree-like roots of this shrub make it drought-tolerant but difficult to move once established so choose your spot wisely. Light preference is full or part sun and medium-dry soil. Deer and rabbits do like this shrub, especially when it is young so protect new transplants in the early years. The beautiful white flowers attract many pollinators. New Jersey Tea is one of the host plants of the Spring Azure. The boiling water treatment (Germination Code: B) helps break open the hard seed coat. This may happen naturally with freeze/thaw cycles, but better germination can be expected if hot water treatment is done before fall planting outside, or artificial cold-moist stratification in a fridge (Germination Code: C).

Cinna arundinacea,Partial; Shade,Wet; Medium-Wet; Medium,3,3,,August; September,Deer Resistant,C(60),"This attractive perennial grass has tufts of upright, sturdy, hairless stems of light green or almost blue-green color. Atop the tall stem is a dense, wavy inflorescence or whole flower head, which droops under the weight of the spikelets. During late summer bloom, it typically towers over other vegetation, its color evolving to light tan as the grains ripen. This grass is typically found in small vegetative colonies or as scattered individual plants in wet woodlands and damp thickets in fertile, loamy soil. Cinna arundinacea is native from Quebec and Maine to Ontario and Minnesota all the way south to Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Arkansas. In Massachusetts and Vermont is has an at-risk conservation status. Taller, woodland grasses like Wood Reed Grass and Bottlebrush Grass are typically left alone by white-tailed deer and other herbivores as they prefer the understory shrubs and forbs. It may also be referred to as Stout Reed Grass."

Its most distinct characteristic is the large, blunt seeds, or grains that make this grass distinguisable from other grasses in the late-summer or early-fall. It's an attractive grass in the spring and summer with shiny green blades that turn golden tan in the fall. Its short stature make it ideal for landscaping or as a ground cover in shaded, rich soil areas. It can be used as a stream-bank stabilizing plant in difficult shaded areas; it can form large plant colonies in ideal conditions by the way of creeping rhizomes. It is also resistant to the juglone of Black Walnut trees."

Mertensia virginica,Partial; Shade,Medium-Wet; Medium,2,2,Blue,April; May,Deer Resistant; Recommeded for Landscaping,C(60); M,"One of the most beautiful species of spring ephemerals are Virginia bluebells (Mertensia virginica). These lovely plants are in the family Boraginaceae, which makes them relatives of other familiar species like Forget-me-not, Lungwort, and Comfrey. Bluebells enjoy rich, well-drained soils where they can form large colonies over time. Growing fast, the flower shoots quickly give way to some of the most beautiful flowers east of the Mississippi. The flowers start off pink and gradually turn over to their famous shade of light blue as they mature. Bees, especially female Bumblebees that fly in early spring, will often be seen visiting the flowers. Only the largest bees have the ability to push their way up the tube. The real champions of bluebell pollination are butterflies and moths. It is stunning to watch them perch delicately on the rim of the flower. A colony of bluebells is truly an amazing sight to behold! The blooms will last for many weeks in early spring (April and May) and will go dormant by mid-summer. Virginia Bluebells prefer soils typical of a woodland - a little on the wet side."

In the Mississippi Valley, it can be found growing in the shallow soils on rocky bluff tops. Formerly called Aster ptarmicoides, its very Solidago-like stems befits its genus reclassification. Since being called Solidago ptarmicoides, the genus has changed again to Oligoneuron. Many species have been reclassified as it has become cheaper to do genetic analyses of different species."
Oligoneuron rigidum,Full; Partial,Medium-Wet; Medium; Medium-Dry; Dry,4,4,Yellow,August; September; October,Deer Resistant; Pollinators; Recommended but Aggressive,C(60),"Stiff Goldenrod has larger, flatter flower clusters than most Goldenrods. The leaves turn nice shades of red in the fall. For a colorful fall show, plant Stiff Goldenrod with other fall bloomers such as Button Blazing Star, Little Bluestem, New England Aster and Sweet Black-eyed Susan. As for common names, you may hear it referred to as Rigid Goldenrod or Prairie Goldenrod. Another botanical name is Solidago rigida. On many sites Stiff Goldenrod can be a prolific self seeder. It does well in a broad range of soil conditions so on small sites or in home garden/landscapes removal of the seed head before the seed is ripe is preferable to weeding unwanted seedlings. Whatever your preference or situation may be, there is a goldenrod to suit all occasions. Sadly, goldenrods often get blamed for causing the dreaded hayfever. This is simply not true. Their pollen is quite large and sticky to better adhere to the body of visiting insects. Because of this, goldenrod pollen cannot become airborne and can never make its way into your sinuses. The true cause of hayfever is the wind pollinated ragweeds, which broadcast copious amounts of lightweight pollen into the air. We cannot stress enough how important goldenrods are on the landscape. Including them on your property will provide ecosystem services well into the fall when most other plant life is shutting down."

It grows in the wild in mesic forests and on wooded slopes. The white flowers of this plant can be found at the top clustered into four to seven flowers each. The leaves resemble ferns; dark green leaves are compounded in threes one or two times and have serrated edges. All surfaces of Sweet Cicely are hairy, especially on veins on the underside of the leaves. Towards the end of the season dry brown seeds appear that split into two when ripe. This plant would be a good addition to a woodland garden as it thrives in the shade and in wetter soils. Sweet Cicely also attracts beneficial insects that will become food for small mammals and birds. The roots, when dug, are said to give off an anise-like flavor.  "

Phlox divaricata,Partial; Shade,Medium-Wet; Medium; Medium-Dry,1,1,Blue,April; May; June,Pollinators; Recommeded for Landscaping,C(60),"This is a Phlox for shade or partial shade and medium to drier soils. Wild Blue Phlox is rhizomatous and will spread slowly but steadily. It is also commonly referred to as Blue Phlox, Woodland Phlox, or Louisiana Phlox. Some may call it Wild Sweet William, but that is the common name we give to Phlox maculata. The flowers, atop sticky stems, are slightly fragrant and range in color from pale blue to lavender to violet. Deer seem to have little interest in Phlox, but rabbits especially like Wild Blue. Dame's Rocket, an invasive, non-native plant in the mustard family is often confused as being a native Phlox. It blooms at relatively the same time as Phlox divaricata, P. pilosa, and P. maculata. The easiest way to distinuish Dame's Rocket is the four flower petals while true native Phlox have five petals. Dame's Rocket also has alternate leaves and Phlox has opposite leaves. *Seed of this species is kept under refrigeration (33-38 F) in our warehouse.

Little Bluestem is an iconic warm season grass of the prairie habitat that is commonly used in both landscaping and restoration projects. In shortgrass prairies, it is often the dominant species along with Side-oats Grama. In tallgrass prairies, companion grasses include Big Bluestem, Indian Grass, and Switch Grass. One of the most widely distributed species of grass in the US, Little Bluestem is very drought-tolerant, but it can do well in moist situations too. Farmers have used this species for hay, but consecutive years of haying will likely cause the species to disappear. In a garden setting, Little Bluestem is valued for its blue-green color in the summer and, after the first frost, it turns beautiful shades of brown, copper, and crimson that will remain all winter. The grass gets fluffy white seed heads that also adds seasonal interest. Some gardeners choose to remove the seed fluff to control the spread of young seedlings. Little Bluestem is an excellent plant for wildlife. Little Bluestem serves as the larval host for several skipper species including the Dusted Skipper, Cobweb Skipper, Ottoe Skipper, Indian Skipper, Swarthy Skipper, and the Crossline Skipper. Other insects that feed on Little Bluestem include grasshoppers, Prairie Walkingsticks, the leaf-mining beetles, thrips, spittlebugs, and leafhoppers. The seeds of this grass are eaten by songbirds. Little bluestem provides necessary overwintering habitat and resources for many insects and birds. Female bumble bee queens nest at the base of bunch grasses, like Little Bluestem, where they are protected until they emerge in the Spring.

Scutellaria leonardii,Full; Partial,Medium-Dry; Dry,0.25,0.5,Purple,May; June,,C(60),"Small Skullcap or Leonard’s Skullcap is a member of the mint family. It is perfect for bordering gardens or filling in gaps because this plant loves to sprawl across the ground in dense mats. Flowers are small with blue-violet mottles on white, and in pairs with fine, glandless hairs on the outer surface. The opposing leaves are angled upward with a lance-like shape and toothless edges that curl under. The square stem provides a study support for the relatively short plant. Scutellaria leondardii is highly recommended in boulevard gardens because it reseeds and greatly benefits a wide range of pollinators. Occasionally, plants may not produce the blue speckled petals, forming instead a very small, closed white tube from which a cleistogamous (self-pollinating) flower will bloom. Some great companions of Small Skullcap are the beautiful Prairie Smoke, Pussytoes and Wild Petunia, which also establish well as garden borders."

Despite their common name, the Blue-eyed Grasses are not grasses at all but rather members of the Iris family. They handle competition quite well and readily spread via underground rhizomes. A large patch of these little plants is truly a sight to behold, especially if you are a bee. Pollinators readily take to the flowers, which is nice considering that most Sisyrinchium species bloom and provide pollen and nectar to our winged friends before some of the larger summer flowers really get going. The petals even provide markings that are like runway signs for pollinators. Yellow is a favorite of bees and the yellow center of this flower is a perfect announcement of yummy treats within. The leaves of all Sisyrinchium plants are stiff, fan-like, and in deep green bunches that resemble grass with wider and unbranched stems. See also, Prairie Blue-eyed Grass and Stout Blue-eyed Grass."

Or a splash of color during the spring to summer transition? Consider the Blue-eyed Grasses (Sisyrinchium species)! What they lack in size they certainly make up for in beauty and tenacity.

Taenidia integerrima,Full; Partial; Shade,Medium; Medium-Dry,3,3,Yellow,May; June; July,Deer Resistant; Recommeded for Landscaping,C(60); M,"Blooming species become few after the initial green-up of spring. Yellow Pimpernel provides delicate yellow umbels of flowers through the heat of early summer. It is a fine textured plant that smells of celery when crushed and prefers drier, woodland edges. Deer, at least in our area, mostly avoid it. Rarely seen in cultivation, the flowers attract many small spring-flying insects and the leaves feed the caterpillars of the Black Swallowtail and Ozark Swallowtail, and should be used more often in the landscape if only for this purpose. Although this butterfly host plant prefers drier, woodland edge habitats, it will also do well in full sun and medium soil. Our website also features the following species with similar yellow umbel blooms, blooming late-spring or early-summer: Thaspium trifoliatum var. trifoliatum (Meadow Parsnip), Polytaenia nuttallii (Prairie Parsley) and Zizia aurea (Golden Alexanders). All of these important perennial native plants should not be confused with the similar-looking Pastinaca sativa (Wild Parsnip), a highly invasive Eurasian biennial commonly found on roadsides and other disturbed sites. Wild Parsnip is taller than the aforementioned natives, blooms later, and can cause painful skin burns."

Tephrosia virginiana,Full; Partial,Medium; Medium-Dry; Dry,1,1,Pink; Yellow,June; July,Deer Resistant,C(10),"Goat's Rue is an eye-catching plant of dry upland, often sandy or acidic prairies and gravel deposits near several of the major US rivers.   The late-spring to early-summer blooms are like no other prairie plant; the dense clusters of flowers are at the top of the stems with a pale yellow upper petal and two smaller fuschia lower petals. This legume's seeds form among attractive feather-like, greenish-gray leaves in late summer. Distinctive hairy, flat 2""-long pods cover the plant, making identification easy. Choose a dry, moderately sunny spot wisely because, once established, Goat's Rue does not divide and does not like to be moved.   In past traditions, Goat's Rue was used to treat ailments such as tuberculosis, rheumatism and bladder problems. The plant also is being studied in cancer research. This perennial has a deep taproot that eventually branches into fibrous roots. Other common names include Catgut, Devil's Shoestrings, Hoary Pea, Wild Sweetpea, North American Turkey Pea, and Virginia Tephrosia."

Uvularia grandiflora,Partial; Shade,Medium-Wet; Medium; Medium-Dry,1,1,Yellow,April; May,Recommeded for Landscaping,E; L,"A member of the Lily family, Bellwort is an excellent early-blooming native shade plant for the woodland garden, shaded border front, wildflower garden or naturalized area. It spreads slowly by rhizomes so you can achieve a mass planting look under shade trees or along wood margins in a relatively short amount of time. The Bellwort flowers and leaves have an overall droopy appearance when in bloom. However, after seeds are set, the leaves of Uvularia take on a different look, somewhat like a needle threading the stem through the leaves. Bumblebees, Mason bees, Halictid bees, and Andrenid bees feed from the nectar and collect pollen from the flowers which bloom April to May. Bellwort is easily grown in average, well-drained soil in partial to full shade. Other common names in use are Largeflower Bellwort or Great Merrybells"
